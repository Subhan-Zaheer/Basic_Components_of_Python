#Operators in Python
# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operator
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5 + 6 is : ", 5 + 6)
# print("5 - 6 is : ", 5 - 6)
# print("5 ** 6 is : ", 5 ** 6)
# print("5 / 6 is : ", 5 / 6)
# print("25 // 6 is : ", 25 // 6)

# Assignment Operator
# x = 5
# x += 6
# print("Value of x is : ", x)

# Identity Operators
# (is) and (is not)
#
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is not b)

# Membership Operators
# (in) and (not in)
# ls = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(1 not in ls)

# Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise | operator and & operator
# This Operator will calculate the value of two operands bit wise
# 00
# 11 if we are doing | operator
# --
# 11
# print(0 & 3)
# print(0 | 3)
